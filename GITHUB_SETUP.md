# 🚀 GitHub Pages Setup - FIXED FOR YOUR ISSUE!

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED!

Your previous issue (only 404 working) was because:
- Pages were in `/pages` folder
- GitHub Pages needs `index.html` in ROOT
- Paths were using `../` which broke on GitHub

## ✅ WHAT I FIXED:

1. ✅ **Moved all pages to ROOT** (index.html, about.html, etc.)
2. ✅ **Updated ALL paths** from `../assets/` to `./assets/`
3. ✅ **Updated ALL paths** from `../partials/` to `./partials/`
4. ✅ **Structure is now GitHub Pages ready!**

## 📁 YOUR CURRENT STRUCTURE (CORRECT FOR GITHUB):

```
LAW/                           ← Your repository root
├── index.html                 ← Homepage (MUST be in root!)
├── about.html
├── attorneys.html
├── contact.html
├── ... (all other pages)
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── img/
├── partials/
│   ├── header.html
│   ├── footer.html
│   └── modals.html
├── docs/
└── README.txt
```

## 🔥 UPLOAD TO GITHUB - STEP BY STEP
